This is a Zelda Themed game in which the user clicks on images of different "Rupees" in attempt to reach a computer generated random number in order to win the game. 

When the game begins, each "Rupee" is given a computer generated random number and the user has to figure out what that number is by clicking on the image and then looking at their displayed "Current Score". 

If the user goes over the "Target Score", then the player loses and the game resets while simultaneously logging a "Loss". The same thing happens when a player gets their score to the "Target Score", with the exception that it logs a win every time.
